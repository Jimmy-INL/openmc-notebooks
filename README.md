OpenMC Notebooks
----------------

This repository contains a set of example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating
various capabilities in OpenMC from basic model building to advanced features
such as depletion/activation, CAD geometry universes, etc.

Notebook versioning
-------------------

Notebooks contained in the `main` branch of this repository can be expected to
work with the latest release of OpenMC. Note, `main` **is not the default branch
of this repository** and must be checked out after cloning the repo.

Previous versions notebooks will be tagged with the corresponding OpenMC version
with which they are expected to work. These tags can be used to checkout
notebooks ensured to be compatible with the corresponding release of OpenMC.

Continuous development of these notebooks occurs in the `develop` branch, the
default branch of this repository. We ask that any updates or contributions to
the repository occur based on this branch.
