OpenMC Notebooks
----------------

This repository contains a set of example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating
various capabilities in OpenMC from model building to advanced features like
depletion/activation and CAD geometry.

Notebook versioning
-------------------

Notebooks contained in the `main` branch of this repository should work with the
latest version of OpenMC. Note, `main` **is not the default branch of this
repository** and must be checked out after cloning the repo.

Previous versions of the notebooks will be tagged with the corresponding OpenMC
version with which they work. These tags can be used to checkout notebooks
ensured to be compatible with the corresponding release of OpenMC.

Continuous development of these notebooks occurs in the `develop` branch, the
default branch of this repository. We ask that any updates or contributions to
the repository occur based on this branch.
